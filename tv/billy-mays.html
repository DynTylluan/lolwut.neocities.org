	<H2>Billy Mays</H2>
	<P><I><Q>HI, BILLY MAYS HERE!</Q> &mdash;Billy Mays</I></P>
	<P>Without a doubt, Billy Mays is my favorite salesman. I quite enjoy his signature loud, energetic delivery, which gives him an incredible charisma and makes him appear to be truly enthusiastic for whatever product he is trying to sell.</P>
	<P>His many commercials aired throughout the 2000s, but initially I did not consider them to be anything special, and instead simply regarded them as more advertising that I had to sit through. He definitely grew on me over the years, though, and I recall that, in the late 2000s, I actually enjoyed watching his commercials&mdash;which can hardly be said of the great majority of television advertisements I've seen&mdash;and once again having his shouting voice and friendly, familiar face appear on my TV. I remember <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwroQIb-QFM">his OxiClean commercials</A> the best, of course, but I also remember pretty well the ones for <A HREF="https://www.vidlii.com/watch?v=a3dwX1e3MNa">the Big City Slider Station</A>, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NHHhIv3G1k">Kaboom</A>, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt3A2780agg">Mighty Mendit</A> (which we actually bought&mdash;thanks, Billy!), <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-TAB4okz5Q">Mighty Putty</A> (which we also bought&mdash;thanks again, Billy!), and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvuN1JK4FYU">Mighty Tape</A>.</P>
	<P>He most certainly died before his time during the Great Celebrity Death Wave of June 2009 (which, most notably, also included the death of Michael Jackson), and I genuinely felt sad back then over the loss. I also remember that his various commercials continued to air on television for probably around a few weeks after his death, but were afterwards pulled; <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx-RwdJILWk">the advertisements for OxiClean, in particular, I recall as having no pitchman for a while after his death</A>, to then switching to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Sullivan_(pitchman)">Anthony Sullivan</A>, but to me, it simply wasn't the same&mdash;Billy Mays will always be <EM>the</EM> OxiClean guy.</P>
