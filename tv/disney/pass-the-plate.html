	<H2><CITE>Pass the Plate</CITE></H2>
	<P>This is a mini-series that began airing on Disney Channel in October 2007. The episodes are a few minutes in length, and would be shown during the breaks between the channel's programming. Each episode focuses on a particular food or type of food, and how it is traditionally prepared and eaten in various countries around the world; the main host is none other than Brenda Song (who by then had a very established name on the channel), with the other international hosts being stars of their respective countries' local branch of Disney Channel.</P>
	<P>Out of all the mini-series that were shown on Disney Channel back when I still watched it, <CITE>Pass the Plate</CITE> was my favorite (<A HREF="cars-toons.html"><CITE>Cars Toons</CITE></A> and <CITE>Brian O'Brian</CITE> are close seconds). I would always feel a bit of delight when, during a break, I started hearing <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjW0ktYIBv0">that pleasant, soft electric guitar music that would play at the beginning of each episode</A>, because I knew then that an episode of <CITE>Pass the Plate</CITE> was starting. I found the series to be quite entertaining while also being informative, at least for a children's mini-series; seeing the familiar face of Brenda Song also contributed to my enjoyment of it. I recall that it was shown quite frequently throughout 2008 and 2009, and even a bit into the early 2010s, so for me, it will always be an important part of Ribbon Era (2007&ndash;2010) Disney Channel.</P>
	<P>In 2013 the series was, apparently, redone with two kids from <CITE>Jessie</CITE> now serving as the hosts, but I don't really care about those episodes; they must have started airing after I stopped watching Disney Channel, as I don't remember seeing them at all. It is the original 10 Brenda Song episodes that I care about, as they are the ones I watched and re-watched almost daily as part of my Disney Channel experience.</P>
	<P>Listed below are the original 10 Brenda Song episodes of <CITE>Pass the Plate</CITE>; the first 6 each visit a handful of countries per episode, whereas the later 4 (unfortunately) visit only 2 per episode. Even if you have never before seen these episodes and thus have no nostalgia for them, I would still urge you to watch them&mdash;each one is only a few minutes in length, and I genuinely think that you'll find them interesting.</P>
