	<H2>Mitchel Musso Can Sing, Too?</H2>
	<P>Soon after I first began watching <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>, I learned that Miley Cyrus could sing (obviously), as well as Billy Ray Cyrus. When later on Emily Osment also began singing and launched a music career, it did not strike me as especially surprising, perhaps partly because she was listed second in the opening credits, immediately after Miley, and partly because Disney Channel seemed to me to manufacture more female singers than male ones. What instead managed to catch me off guard was when Mitchel Musso began singing, too.</P>
	<P>I recall that the first time I ever heard Mitchel sing was with Emily, in <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-R052wx7cc">the music video for <Q>If I Didn't Have You</Q></A>, which aired on Disney Channel around mid-2008, during the breaks between the channel's programming; as it was only one song, however, and because he was singing with Emily rather than by himself, I didn't think too much of it: perhaps it was a one-time collaboration with Emily Osment, undertaken simply because they were co-stars. Afterwards I remember hearing him sing <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNWBnagZkM">a shortened version of <Q>Let's Make This Last 4Ever</Q> in the <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE> season 3 episode <Q>You Gotta Lose That Job</Q></A>, which premiered on 16 February 2009, as well as seeing <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL2gTqic_BY">the music video for <Q>The Three Rs</Q></A> on Disney Channel at right around the same time, which aired during the breaks. At that point I vaguely remember realizing that Mitchel Musso was very likely about to embark on a music career, but even then I still had some hesitation in this belief, as I thought those songs had been, respectively, a shortened version recorded specifically for that episode, and a recording merely for some <CITE>Schoolhouse Rock!</CITE> thing that Disney Channel thought Mitchel Musso ought to sing.</P>
	<P>For me, the true realization came during May/June 2009, when <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH3skU9C4T8">his song <Q>Hey</Q></A> was released, and when the corresponding music video began airing during breaks on Disney Channel. I first heard the song through watching the music video on Disney Channel (which was often shortened to various lengths when it aired on the channel, but might have been shown in its entirety on rare occasions), and I can recall quite clearly that I immediately took a liking to it&mdash;it was one of the few times in which, in all my years of watching Disney Channel, I thought that a song that was being promoted through the channel sounded very good and catchy. I also liked the music video itself: the visual effects I found to be quite cool and trendy, and Mitchel Musso, meanwhile, looks very stylish and (I will venture to say) handsome in it; the whole thing certainly looks like a product of the 2000s&mdash;which is a good thing, by the way. I enjoyed it so much that later on I actually bothered to head to <A HREF="../../../comp/youtube.html">YouTube</A> so that I could watch the entire music video and listen to the whole song on there, something I very rarely did for any music being promoted through Disney Channel.</P>
	<P>The music video for <Q>Hey</Q> continued to air on Disney Channel throughout the summer of 2009, and I remember feeling delighted whenever I saw that it was about to be shown again; I welcomed each opportunity to once again enjoy the video and listen to the song. Watching the music video for <Q>Hey</Q> during the breaks is definitely one part of my warm memories of Disney Channel during the summer of 2009, when I was on summer break from school. Very quickly I came to realize that Michel Musso had established himself as a singer, and as a result I admired and liked him even more. (Soon I also wondered whether Jason Earles and/or Mois&#xE9;s Arias would start singing and begin music careers of their own, but now it seems like things stopped at Mitchel.)</P>
