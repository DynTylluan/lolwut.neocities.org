	<H2>Watching the Premiere of Season 3 of <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE></H2>
	<P>By November 2008, I was very much into <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>; I had been watching it on Disney Channel regularly for about a year and half already. The world was in the middle of the great <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE> craze back then, and Disney Channel had been intensively promoting the new, third season of the show throughout October 2008 with <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V04YTB5IYn4">a series of <Q>New in November</Q> promos using the song <Q>It's All Right Here</Q></A> (see also <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPfW8Que5pE">promo variation 2</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gavi-KVaQOU">promo variation 3</A>), which I remember very well.</P>
	<P>By then, I did not watch TV as obsessively as I did in the past, and usually I didn't bother watching premieres of new episodes (I would just watch the rerun when it happened to air, and when it was convenient for me), but I guess that, because it was a season premiere instead of simply a new episode, and because Disney Channel had been promoting it so heavily, I actually pulled myself away from what I was doing (probably using the computer) and turned on our big-screen TV a little before 8 P.M. on Sunday, 2 November 2008 just to watch this.</P>
	<P>The new episode itself, <Q>He Ain't a Hottie, He's My Brother</Q>, was pretty typical of the show. At the very end, in a <EM>wildly creative</EM> twist, all the events of the episode turn out to be Miley's dream. But what was interesting for me back then were two things: firstly, Hannah Montana's wardrobe had changed and the wig had gotten shorter; and, secondly, the opening sequence had been completely re-done, with entirely new graphics and using a new version of <Q>The Best of Both Worlds</Q>. Out of all the TV shows that I watched or had watched back then, <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE> was, I think, the first one to completely change its opening sequence (rather than, for example, merely changing a few of the clips from the show but leaving everything else the same); this was not surprising, considering how huge the franchise had become by that point. They certainly managed to make the new opening sequence grander than the old one.</P>
	<P>This was a pretty exciting event for me, and one which I remember quite fondly.</P>
