	<H2>Just How Old Is Jason Earles?</H2>
	<P>I remember that there was an interesting controversy during <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>'s original run concerning Jason Earles' real age. Jason was born on 26 April 1977, so as of March 2021, he is 43 years old. The thing was, though, back when <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE> was still airing on Disney Channel, for a long time most of us didn't know the year of his birth because we couldn't reliably find out, not even with the Internet.</P>
	<P>Now that I look back upon it, the entire situation was very unusual and very strange, even unbelievable: here was one of the main cast members of not just any Disney Channel show, but <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>, its immensely popular flagship series in the late 2000s, and most of the world did not even know, and also could not reliably learn, such a basic fact as the guy's age. I can remember back in the day that not even Wikipedia (my  main source of information back then; if Wikipedia didn't know, then it truly was a mystery) could tell me: its archived articles concerning Jason Earles from, for example, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=102776056">23 January 2007</A>, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=148195339">31 July 2007</A>, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=180740324">29 December 2007</A>, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=195163298">1 March 2008</A>, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=230709244">8 August 2008</A>, and <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=261523379">2 January 2009</A> either do not list his birthday at the very beginning of the page, or list two possible birthdays. Even as late as <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Earles&amp;oldid=285331125">21 April 2009</A>, Wikipedia still did not know.</P>
	<P>Jason Earles himself and Disney Channel kept pretty quiet about it back in the day. He was almost 29 when <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE> premiered, whereas his Jackson Stewart character was (early on in the show) a teenager in high school, so the age difference probably would have hurt Disney Channel's goal of selling us, its audience back then, that Jason was a <Q>kid</Q>. I recall that for a while after I first got hooked on <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>, I thought that Jason was around the age his Jackson character was supposed to be. Then, one day (probably in 2008), I stumbled upon a YouTube video (which I could not find again when writing this page) made by somebody who believed that Jason was significantly older than his Jackson Stewart character. I can remember that the author of the video argued that Jason Earles was wearing makeup when he was portraying Jackson, so as to look younger; additionally, the author also presented a picture of Jason from a movie or TV show he acted in a few years before <CITE>Hannah Montana</CITE>, in which he appeared pretty much the same&mdash;something quite unlikely if he were a teenager. At the time, I do not think this video convinced me fully that he was much older, but after watching it, I did have my doubts; when I went to check his Wikipedia page, his age was not listed, and then I really began to wonder.</P>
	<P>Most of us probably discovered his real age later on, when Wikipedia was finally able to nail down his birthday definitively. Back then, I thought that it was a little odd that he was in his thirties portraying a teenager in a children's show, but it did not detract from my enjoyment of the show at all. I did not really mind; I thought he was very funny as Jackson.</P>
