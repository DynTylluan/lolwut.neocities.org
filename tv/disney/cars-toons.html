	<H2><CITE>Cars Toons</CITE></H2>
	<P>This is a mini-series that began airing on the channel in October 2008. The episodes are short films, most of which are a few minutes in length, that take place in the <CITE>Cars</CITE> world and feature the Mater character recounting to Lightning McQueen unbelievable situations and events in which he was involved. Lightning interrupts the story partway through, usually to express his disbelief; Mater then reminds him that he, too, was involved, upon which Lightning McQueen is magically inserted into the story at that point. Each episode typically ends with a character or element from Mater's story appearing in the present time, which humorously suggests to the viewer that there may be some truth in Mater's account.</P>
	<P>I had watched the film <CITE>Cars</CITE> soon after its release to theaters in June 2006, and had enjoyed it thoroughly, so I was unsurprisingly delighted when, in or very soon after October 2008, I was watching Disney Channel one day and was greeted by one of these shorts during the breaks between the channel's programming; in the following days and weeks, as I saw new episodes and re-watched those I had already seen, I realized that this was a new, quality mini-series that had begun to air on the network.</P>
	<P>Although the series has 15 total episodes, they were released in irregular intervals over the course of nearly 6 years (from 2008 to 2014), and it is only the first 6 that I remember: the three original shorts <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/rescue-squad-mater-4bb39e33baf6aa8833003b15">Rescue Squad Mater</A></Q>, <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/mater-the-greater-4bb39e35d9f6ba8833003b15">Mater the Greater</A></Q>, and <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/el-materdor-4bb39e806142aa8833003b15">El Materdor</A></Q>, which all premiered in October 2008, and which I remember the best; the fifth episode <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/unidentified-flying-mater-4bb39f1c72baba8833003b15">Unidentified Flying Mater</A></Q>, which I also recall pretty well; and the fourth and sixth episodes, <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/tokyo-mater-4bb39d8bf71dea8833003b15">Tokyo Mater</A></Q> and <Q><A HREF="https://video.disney.com/watch/monster-truck-mater-4bb39d7f99d1fa8833003b15">Monster Truck Mater</A></Q>, which I remember somewhat clearly. (The <Q>Tokyo Mater</Q> episode is noticeably longer than the others, and, perhaps because of this, was not shown on Disney Channel as frequently.)</P>
	<P>The <CITE>Cars Toons</CITE> shorts aired quite frequently during the end of 2008, throughout 2009, and even a little bit into the early 2010s. Today I consider them an important part of Ribbon Era (2007&ndash;2010) Disney Channel, back when such high-quality content could be found even in the breaks between the channel's main shows. <CITE>Cars Toons</CITE> was one of my favorites amongst the many entertaining mini-series that were shown by the network during the breaks, and out of all such series that aired on Disney Channel back when I still regularly watched it, I would say that probably only <CITE>Brian O'Brian</CITE> matches it, and only <A HREF="pass-the-plate.html"><CITE>Pass the Plate</CITE></A> beats it.</P>
