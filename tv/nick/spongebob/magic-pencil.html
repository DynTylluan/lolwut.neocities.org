	<H2>The Magic Pencil</H2>
	<P>When I first watched <A HREF="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56akvb">the season 2 episode <Q>Frankendoodle</Q></A> back in 2002, I remember being particularly captivated by the <Q>magic</Q> pencil featured in it. As I was somewhat of a credulous child back then (I thought for many years as a kid that fruit jelly actually came from jellyfish&mdash;thanks, <CITE>SpongeBob SquarePants</CITE>!), I believed to a degree that pencils really did take on the fantastic properties shown in the episode when they were dropped into the ocean. I thought it was possible, for example, to draw usable objects and even living things with a regular pencil once it was in the ocean; as I had never been to the ocean, what possible evidence from personal experience could I have to refute what I was watching?</P>
	<P>Looking back, I suppose this was a sign of the great influence that <CITE>SpongeBob SquarePants</CITE> had over me when I was a kid. Though I knew back then, of course, that sea sponges and starfish couldn't actually speak, every now and then I interpreted some fictional element of the show as true or partly true. Hillenburg was a marine biologist, after all, so I assumed that those things that I saw in his television show which I could not contradict through personal knowledge or experience were probably true; he knew far more than I did regarding the ocean and marine life, and so I believed him.</P>
