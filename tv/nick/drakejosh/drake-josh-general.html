	<H2>General Thoughts on <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE></H2>
	<P>This series, truly, is my favorite Nickelodeon live action show, Dan Schneider's greatest work, and a masterpiece of the children's/teen sitcom genre. It is very funny, and has produced many memorable quotes; no wonder people still talk about this show, even today.</P>
	<P>I don't know when I first started watching this show regularly. I had watched <CITE>The Amanda Show</CITE> regularly during the early 2000s and definitely knew who Drake Bell and Josh Peck were from that, and I also knew about <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE> when it first started airing in January 2004, but, unfortunately, I actually ignored it for most of its original run and only started watching it regularly when it was maybe halfway into its final season, around early/mid-2007. I can remember watching the premiere of <CITE>Really Big Shrimp</CITE> on 3 August 2007, so I had been watching the show for a while before then. I actually started to appreciate this show after it had ended its original run.</P>
	<P>Nickelodeon frequently aired reruns of the show during the late 2000s, although I can recall a short break (lasting maybe a few months) in airings before the premiere of <CITE>Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh</CITE> in December 2008, after which the reruns continued, and lasted throughout 2009. I don't remember <Q>main</Q> Nickelodeon airing reruns past 2009, although when I first discovered TeenNick in the summer of 2013, <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE> reruns were being shown pretty much every day on there. Unfortunately, since then TeenNick has been steadily reducing the frequency of airings for <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE>, but it's comforting to see that, even today, in 2021, you can <EM>still</EM> watch this show on live TV: as of March 2021, TeenNick airs it once a week, for a few hours (a handful of episodes back-to-back) on Saturday evenings.</P>
