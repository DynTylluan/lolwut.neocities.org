	<H2>Josh Peck</H2>
	<P><I><Q>Emphasis. EMPHASIS!</Q> &mdash;Josh Nichols</I></P>
	<P>I knew who Josh Peck was from his work on <CITE>The Amanda Show</CITE>, but it was undoubtedly his work on <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE> where I realized how funny of a comedic actor he is. He never seems to shy away from shouting or screaming a line, making a wacky face, or doing a bit of crazy physical comedy. His Josh Nichols character, and also Jerry Trainor's Crazy Steve character, are definitely the funniest in the show&mdash;even funnier, I think, than the Drake Parker character.</P>
	<P>I have read some remarks online that showed annoyance and disapproval of his <Q>overacting</Q> in <CITE>Drake &amp Josh</CITE>, but I think that, in a comedy, this is precisely what provides the best type of humor: be loud, be outrageous, be over-the-top, do ridiculously absurd physical comedy, make bizarre and exaggerated faces, play outlandish characters, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Trainor">scream all your lines</A>! I never really did understand that whole deadpan thing, and generally I don't find it very funny.</P>
	<P>He also lost a great deal of weight during the original run of <CITE>Drake &amp; Josh</CITE> (good for him), and you can tell very easily which season an episode belongs to by looking at Josh's physique: if he is fat, then you're watching season 1 or 2; if he's only a little bit chubby, then you're watching season 3; and if he's not overweight at all, then you're watching season 4. (Quite a helpful indicator, isn't it?)</P>
