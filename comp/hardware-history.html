	<H2>My Computing Hardware History</H2>
	<P>Below I list the computing hardware I use at home, as is customary for computer nerds. However, as this is a nostalgia site, I felt the urge to list also my past hardware (with dates of use) alongside my current hardware. I have tried to provide as complete a chronology here as possible, but I make no guarantee of complete accuracy, as I didn't have very much in terms of records besides my memory. I hope that this information will still be of some interest to you.</P>

			iBUYPOWER custom pre-built, post-upgrade, from December 2017 to present. In December 2017, after being dissatisfied with the GIGABYTE motherboard, I decided to upgrade to a higher-end Intel motherboard, which also required upgrading the processor and memory. Changing these three components (particularly the motherboard), of course, is like getting an entirely new computer, which is why I have listed it here as a separate item.
