	<H2>Pepe the Frog</H2>
	<P>Pepe has been posted on 4chan for at least a decade now, but originally he was little more than a smiling cartoon frog with the catchphrase <Q>Feels good man</Q>. He has grown and changed over time, though, and a few years ago, when /pol/ began to draw him in Nazi clothing for fun, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) took notice and proceeded to freak out over an Internet meme of a cartoon frog, and afterwards decided to officially list him as a <Q>hate symbol</Q>:</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="../../images/pepe-demotivator.jpg" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="750" ALT="Internet. Serious Business." TITLE="Internet. Serious Business."></P>
	<P>We at /pol/ all found it absolutely hilarious when that happened.</P>
	<P>It's been more than decade since I first encountered <A HREF="serious-business.html">the phrase <Q>The Internet is Serious Business</Q></A>, and it would seem that the sarcasm of it has eluded the ADL. (And, yes, the demotivator is OC.)</P>
	<P><I>See also <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/Pepe">the Encyclopedia Dramatica article on this meme</A>.</I></P>
