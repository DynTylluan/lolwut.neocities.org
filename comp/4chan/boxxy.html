	<H2>Boxxy</H2>
	<P>In January 2009, /b/ was taken by storm over three YouTube videos uploaded by Boxxy (Powerword: Catie Wayne). The three YouTube videos&mdash;<Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcydqSpYN00">FOAR 4DD1 FRUM BOXXY</A></Q>, <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80hx2FfWjow">FOAR ANT FRUM BOXXY</A></Q>, and <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yavx9yxTrsw">FOAR EVERYWUN FRUM BOXXY</A></Q>&mdash;were simply Boxxy talking to the camera in a very hyperactive manner, but apparently a lot of /b/tards found her to be cute, and started developing crushes on her.</P>
	<P>During that time, it seemed to me like every other thread was about Boxxy, and eventually the mods of /b/ got tired of it and started deleting threads which concerned her and banning anybody who tried to discuss her; I even remember that, for a time, merely typing the word <I>boxxy</I> into your comment would auto-ban you from the site. There was a huge argument at the time between newfags and the oldfags: the newfags found the videos to be cute and adorable, and thought that Boxxy could perhaps soften the old attitudes of /b/, while the oldfags found the videos to be annoying, stupid, and cancerous. Personally, I did not really care that much either way, and generally I would just ignore Boxxy threads; even today&mdash;a decade later&mdash;I still have not bothered to watch even one of her videos in its entirety. (Over the years, she has uploaded more videos in the same style to her <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/user/boxxybabee">boxxybabee</A> account.)</P>
	<P>Her legend lives on, though, because even today, you can <EM>still</EM> find the occasional Boxxy thread on /b/, often filled with guys who still consider her the queen of the board. Even though I don't have a particularly strong opinion regarding her, I still recognize her as an important part of 4chan history.</P>
