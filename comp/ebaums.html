	<H2>Old eBaum's World</H2>
	<P>I was introduced to <A HREF="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/">eBaum's World</A> by a friend of mine in school (he was also the one who introduced me to <CITE>RuneScape</CITE>). Although I cannot remember exactly, he most likely told me about the site sometime in late 2004, and I visited it rather frequently from late 2004 until around early/mid-2006, after which I started browsing Newgrounds regularly and only sporadically visited eBaum's for a while, before pretty much abandoning it entirely by mid-2007, when I started using YouTube regularly.</P>
	<P>Ever since I stopped visiting it in the late 2000s, I have not kept track of the evolution of the site. I do remember, though, that it began permitting its users to upload material in the late 2000s; during this time it was also customary during 4chan raids to claim that the raid was entirely the handiwork of the eBaum's World community, and thereby place all the credit/blame on the site. Sadly, since the mid-2010s (and perhaps even earlier), the site seems to have become nothing more than another BuzzFeed-tier clickbait Web site, but back when I visited it frequently in the mid-2000s, it was already a very large entertainment site with Flash animations, Flash games, images, videos, soundboards, and other material <DEL>stolen</DEL> <DEL>copied without permission</DEL> <INS>curated</INS> by Eric Bauman (the site's founder) himself. There was a lot of controversy back in the day over eBaum's World, as a lot of the stuff on it Eric Bauman would often copy without permission from other sites, and then not give proper credit to the original authors. When I still browsed it regularly, though, I was unaware of the controversy and simply enjoyed the entertaining animations and games I could find on it.</P>
	<P>I mostly visited eBaum's World for the Flash animations and games; I rarely ever visited the other sections of the site, and back then I didn't even know there was a forum. Despite having not watched most of those animations for well over a decade, I was quite amazed at how many of them I was still able to remember when I visited the Internet Archive's capture of the Flash animations page from, for example, <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20050109003829/http://www.ebaumsworld.com:80/cartoons.shtml">9 January 2005</A> or <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074151/http://www.ebaumsworld.com:80/flash.html">23 June 2006</A>&mdash;honestly, it would be quicker for me to give you a list of the ones I don't remember. (No single capture of that page lists every Flash animation I viewed back then, as eBaum's World was undoubtedly served with many takedown requests, due to the site's frequent unauthorized copying and hosting of material.)</P>
	<P>Listed below are some of my favorites from the old Flash animations page that I remember watching back then.</P>

	<P>I didn't play most of the Flash games listed on the old games page (the Internet Archive's <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20050712081229/http://www.ebaumsworld.com:80/games.shtml">capture from 12 July 2005</A> is a good one), but the ones that I did play and remember very well are listed below.</P>
