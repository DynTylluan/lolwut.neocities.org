	<H2>Watching <Q>Hare Hare Yukai</Q> on YouTube</H2>
	<P>Although I have never watched <CITE>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</CITE>, I am still familiar with <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mljdpRp41I4">the ending song, <Q>Hare Hare Yukai</Q>, as well as the accompanying dance</A>. I first happened upon it during my early days on YouTube, most likely sometime in early/mid-2007, and immediately I took a liking to it, finding the song to be catchy and the dance to be neat and impressive; I then proceeded to watch the great number of variations, remixes, and live performances of the song/dance that were also on YouTube, which were not particularly hard to find, as the site back then was dominated by anime fans who uploaded many anime-related videos to it. After my initial discovery, I would re-watch videos of the song somewhat frequently throughout the rest of 2007.</P>
	<P>Despite the song and dance themselves being pleasant and upbeat, however, in recent years I cannot help but feel a sense of sadness and regret whenever I encounter the dance, and especially whenever I hear the song. Because I first watched it on YouTube in 2007, <Q>Hare Hare Yukai</Q> inevitably reminds me of my time on old YouTube&mdash;specifically, 2007 YouTube&mdash;and what that site used to be; when I compare that to what it's become today, I feel nothing but disappointment and a sense of loss. It is among the earliest things I watched on YouTube, back when the song and <CITE>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</CITE> were fresh and new, and when YouTube was still good.</P>
