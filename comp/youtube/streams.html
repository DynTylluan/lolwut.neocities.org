	<H2>YouTube Streams</H2>
	<P>This was a chat room feature that YouTube used to have. Unfortunately, when I performed a Web search, I could not find much evidence of its existence besides <A HREF="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=727320&amp;seqNum=4">a short article from 4 May 2007 giving some basic information about it</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kftc5osd4yw">a short YouTube video concerning Streams, which was uploaded on 2 October 2008</A>. Apparently, if the short article is any indication, Streams existed as early as May 2007, but I only discovered it much later; between the second half of 2008 and early 2009 is the best estimate I can give.</P>
	<P>I remember that one day, while I was logged on to my YouTube account and using the site, I noticed a new Streams button in the <Q>Connect with [username]</Q> box (which was below the channel description box), so I clicked on it and was brought to what was pretty much a chat room that played the same YouTube video simultaneously to all the current participants. Each user in the Stream could line up a new video to be played to everybody else, and every YouTube user got their own Stream. I am aware that YouTube has had live streaming for quite some time, but Streams was not live streaming: the videos must already have been uploaded to YouTube first before they could be played back in the Stream.</P>
	<P>At the time, I used my YouTube account primarily for trolling, and so soon after I discovered Streams, inevitably I took to trolling them. I would go into random strangers' Streams and use an auto-typer to flood the chat; I remember very clearly that two pieces of text I used to spam were the lyrics of <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4BQxpXYPk8">the theme song of <CITE>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</CITE></A> (a reference to <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air">an old 4chan meme</A>) and the English-translated lyrics of <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIqGZlglG1E">the national anthem of the Soviet Union</A>. As for videos, I would usually line up <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/Spengbab">Spengbab</A> videos for playing, particularly <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dGCEMWinSc">dandy spengbab</A></Q>, <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0RWj76fj4">Spengbab.</A></Q>, and <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-9Tho7a4TI">spongebab</A></Q>; various speeches by Hitler; or other shocking and disturbing videos I happened to find. Of course, I ended up getting kicked from the Streams pretty quickly, but when that happened, I immediately moved on to another one&mdash;after all, there were more Streams than I could ever troll in any reasonable amount of time.</P>
	<P>YouTube eventually removed Streams later on in (I believe) 2009, after (I suppose) most folks became bored with it and stopped using it, so this method of trolling is now a thing of the past. It was fun while it lasted, though.</P>
