	<P>Out of all the games included with Windows XP, the pinball game (full title <CITE>3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet</CITE>) was the only one I found fun and entertaining enough to spend any significant amount of time playing&mdash;this is not surprising, as all the other bundled games were far less flashy card games or strategy games. I am aware that this game did not make its first appearance on Windows XP, but it was still bundled with the OS; although I frequently used both a desktop running Windows 95 and another one running Windows Millennium Edition for a few years prior to obtaining my first Windows XP machine around mid-2003, and thus might have started up and played the game on those computers, my first clear memories of playing <CITE>3D Pinball</CITE> were on Windows XP. I can remember with some haziness that the first time I started up the game and saw the virtual pinball machine, I was pretty impressed: though by then I had certainly played other video games with much better graphics, for a game which was included with my computer it had good (to me back then, at least) graphics&mdash;much better than any of the other pre-installed games&mdash;as well as plenty of cool sound effects and a neat space theme.</P>
	<P>Throughout the 2000s I would play this game in very sporadic intervals, and generally for only short stretches of time, which probably lasted no longer than a few days. Though it is quite fun for a game included with an OS, in absolute standards, when compared with many other video games I owned, its appeal fades rather quickly. The main draw, I think, is achieving as high a score as possible; I recall one particularly long stretch of playing <CITE>3D Pinball</CITE>, which occurred towards the end of my 2005&ndash;2006 school year, during which, at the conclusion of a game, I attained a high score of over 1 million points (I believe it was around 1.3 million points). Although this is hardly much of an achievement today&mdash;or even back then&mdash;for me as a kid in those days it was nevertheless a moment of much accomplishment and pride. I can still remember the name I entered for this high score when I was prompted by the game: as I was playing the online game <A HREF="../../../gaming/pc/puzzle-pirates.html"><CITE>Puzzle Pirates</CITE></A> at the time, <A HREF="../../../gaming/pc/puzzle-pirates/lunar-eclipse.html">I entered <Q>Bluefinn</Q>, the username of another player who was my captain within that game</A>.</P>
	<P>When I upgraded to Windows 7 in September/October 2009, I was slightly disappointed to learn that <CITE>3D Pinball</CITE> was not pre-installed on it. Afterwards I largely forgot about the game, but sometimes, when I'm in the mood, I will start up my Windows XP virtual machine just to play it for a bit.</P>
