	<P><I><Q>HEY, EVERYBODY! I'M LOOKING AT GAY PORNO!</Q> &mdash;You</I></P>
	<P>This was a shock site that existed back in the day. Any domain that ended with <I>on.nimp.org</I> would redirect to a page with a shock image as the background (Goatse was one I can remember, but there were others), blast an audio clip of a man yelling <Q>HEY, EVERYBODY! I'M LOOKING AT GAY PORNO!</Q>, and cause the Web browser window to move around rapidly on the screen, spawn pop-up windows, and generally become unresponsive. It was effective bait because any number of valid subdomains could be appended, so long as the whole thing ended with <I>on.nimp.org</I>; thus, for example, <I>lolwut.on.nimp.org</I>, <I>www.youtube.on.nimp.org</I>, and <I>download.free.music.on.nimp.org</I> would all correctly redirect to the same page.</P>
	<P>According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, this prank is actually known as <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/Last_Measure">Last Measure</A>, with lastmeasure.zoy.org having been another rather well-known mirror. Unfortunately, as of October 2020, neither domain leads to a working copy of this classic site, though <A HREF="http://archive.org/web">the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</A> has some (mostly) functional captures of both <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20070501000000*/on.nimp.org">on.nimp.org</A> and <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701000000*/lastmeasure.zoy.org">lastmeasure.zoy.org</A>. (Open those archived versions at your own risk.)</P>
