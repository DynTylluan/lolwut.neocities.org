		<LI><A HREF="https://canyonmid.com/">CANYON.MID</A>.</LI>

		<LI><A HREF="https://scaperune.info/">ScapeRune #462</A>: A <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> private server, it is a July 2007 emulator, so the developers will not introduce any garbage that's not supposed to be there: meaning, of course, that the only content that will be included is content that actually existed in <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> during July 2007.

	<H3>Neocities-Specific</H3>
	<P>For those who are unaware, this site is hosted on <A HREF="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</A>, a freemium Web host which also provides some basic social networking features, such as the ability to follow other users' sites. Rather than listing them here, you should instead take a look at <A HREF="https://neocities.org/site/lolwut/follows">the page listing the specific sites on Neocities I follow</A>, which automatically updates whenever I follow a new site (or unfollow an existing one).</P>
	<H3>Web Design Wall of Shame</H3>
	<P>These are Web sites I have encountered that have such a terrible design (regardless of the content of the pages themselves) that I feel I must point them out as examples of what to avoid when making a site.</P>
	<P>If you are short on time and don't wish to view every single site listed below, then just take a look instead at <A HREF="https://everybootstrap.site/">Every Fucking Bootstrap Website Ever</A> and <A HREF="http://everyfuckingwebsite.com/">Every Fucking Website</A>, and you will get a good idea of their design.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>: An awful design by an awful company.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://atom.io/">Atom</A>: There are <A HREF="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">better text editors for Windows</A>, anyway.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://bolt.io/">Bolt</A>.</LI>
		<LI><A HREf="https://browsehappy.com/">BrowseHappy.com</A>.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.bk.com/">Burger King</A>: This link leads to the United States version of their Web site. However, I also took the time to visit the <A HREF="https://www.burgerking.fr/">French</A>, <A HREF="https://www.burgerking.de/">German</A>, <A HREF="https://www.burgerking.co.uk/">British</A>, <A HREF="https://ksa.burgerking.me/ar/Default.aspx">Saudi Arabian</A>, <A HREF="http://www.burgerking.fi/">Finnish</A>, <A HREF="https://www.bkchina.cn/">Chinese</A>, <A HREF="https://www.burgerkingjapan.co.jp/">Japanese</A>, <A HREF="https://burgerkingbangladesh.com/">Bangladeshi</A>, and <A HREF="https://www.burgerking.co.kr/">South Korean</A> versions of their Web site, and each time I was sorely disappointed by the design.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://coda.io/welcome">Coda</A>: Nowadays far too many software start-ups (including this one) embrace flat design on their Web sites so they can look <Q>hip</Q> and <Q>trendy</Q>, but what it really does is make them look juvenile and amateurish.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.codeandtheory.com/">Code and Theory</A>: The home page is so plain and bare that I do not even think it has any design at all.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://github.com/">GitHub</A>: In addition to the horrid design, <A HREF="images/github-ie.png">GitHub doesn't even support Internet Explorer anymore</A>, so why should I even bother with hosting my source code on it?</LI>

		<LI><A HREF="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">McDonald's</A>.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://pollenlondon.com/">Pollen London</A>: This is, without a doubt, the worst one on this list. Never have I witnessed a <Q>Web site</Q> with a more ludicrous design: the video is unnecessary and hogs my computer's resources, the pictures are too large and waste space, the text is too sparse, the entire site is terribly bloated, and the important information&mdash;namely, who they are&mdash;is hidden away in a tiny menu at the top-right corner. Be careful, as these crooks offer Web design services to the general public.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://randomwire.com/">Randomwire</A>: Why does the author feel it necessary to leave such large sections of the page blank and empty?</LI>
		<LI><A HREf="https://www.skype.com/en">Skype</A>: A terrible design by none other than the sublime Microsoft!</LI>

		<LI><A HREF="https://www.tazikiscafe.com/">Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe</A>.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://3.todo.to.it/">Todo - Creative agency</A>: There is such an absurd amount of scrolling that each visitor must do for such a small amount of content; do the authors of this site not know that	there are a hundred better and more efficient ways to present this information?</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://torchbrowser.com/">Torch Browser</A>: Another Web site which wastes my time by forcing me to scroll just so I can read the next sentence.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</A>.</LI>
