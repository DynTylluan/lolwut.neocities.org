	<H2>The <CITE>Cars</CITE> Video Game</H2>
	<P>I saw the film <CITE>Cars</CITE> soon after it was released to theaters back in June 2006. I enjoyed it very much, and soon afterwards, when I was at the store one day with my family and saw the GameCube game based on the movie (which is also named <CITE>Cars</CITE>), I asked my mother to buy it for me, which she did.</P>
	<P>Unlike many other video games I've played, with the <CITE>Cars</CITE> video game, I played it intensively for a stretch of probably two to three weeks back in late June/July 2006, and thereafter never returned to seriously playing it again. (I recall that I did play it again once or twice later on in 2006 or sometime during 2007, but by then I had already completed the story mode, and so those play sessions were quite short.) This certainly does not mean that I found the game to be boring, or that I have no fond memories of it, but rather that it has, in my opinion, not much replay value.</P>
	<P>Admittedly, much of the game's possible replay value for me was reduced because, back when I was playing this game for the first time, I was in a particular stage of my life during which I found much fun in entering as many cheat codes as possible for whatever video game I was playing. I can still remember searching online for cheat codes for this video game very soon after I began playing it, and eventually stumbling upon <A HREF="https://www.cheatcc.com/gc/carscheatscodes.html">a Cheat Code Central page listing all cheats for the game</A>, which I then proceeded to copy and paste into a blank Microsoft Word 2003 document and then print out. I would have this printout next to me whenever I played the game, as some codes needed to be entered every time the game started. (Amazingly, after all these years I still have this piece of paper with me, and was even able to track it down when I was writing this page.)</P>
	<P>Although the story mode, races, and mini-games are fun, and the racing mechanics are solid, the real appeal of the game, I think, lies in other things: the fact that it is based upon the movie and therefore set in the world of <CITE>Cars</CITE>, including the opportunity for the player to directly control Lightning McQueen and other characters from the film, is definitely a delight for any fan of <CITE>Cars</CITE>; the open world environment, complete with day/night cycles and other characters moving around in it on their own, which allows exploration of the in-game Radiator Springs and the surrounding areas; and the game's soundtrack, which is excellent and very memorable. Some of my warmest memories of the game are ones in which I would be speeding around or exploring sections of the game's open world as Lightning McQueen, being amused whenever he said a funny remark, and all the while listening to the genuinely good music that would always be playing&mdash;my favorites are the songs <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HFie93L-bA">C'mon Let's Go</A></Q>, <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkh8ICQ1tE">Free Ride</A></Q>, and especially <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCqweGMoM_c">the Radiator Springs theme (which would also play on the game's main menu)</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxzqu3T1-X4">its night variant</A>.</P>
	<P>I particularly like the Radiator Springs/main menu theme (go listen to it; you will enjoy it). Hearing it today still manages to remind me (more than the other songs) of the various feelings of joy, relaxation, and excitement as I played this game on our big-screen TV while sitting on our artificial-leather couch back in the summer of 2006, when I was finally on summer break from school again, with the house's air conditioner running but with me still feeling occasionally hot, and not having a single care in the world.</P>
