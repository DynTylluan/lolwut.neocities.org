	<H2><CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2</CITE></H2>
	<P>Note that I am talking specifically about the Japanese version of the game here, not the North American release entitled <CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2</CITE>. It is the one with this cover art:</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="../../../images/gnt2-cover-art.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="429" ALT="Cover art for Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2 (Japanese release)" TITLE="Cover art for Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2 (Japanese release)"></P>
	<P>After playing <A HREF="con1.html"><CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</CITE></A>, I was very eager to play any sequels, so when I learned that <CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2</CITE> (<CITE>GNT2</CITE>), the sequel to the first game in the series, was already out in Japan but not in the United States, I couldn't wait and ordered <CITE>GNT2</CITE> online from <A HREF="https://www.play-asia.com/">Play-Asia.com</A> towards the end July 2006. I remember that it took something like 2 to 3 weeks (a painfully long wait for me back then, as I was very anxious to play it) for it ship from Hong Kong all the way to my house in the United States. Being the first video game I ever imported, I was ignorant of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_lockout#Video_games">regional lockout</A>; when, after a long wait, it finally arrived at my house and I inserted the disc into my GameCube, I was disappointed to find that I couldn't play it because my GameCube's region-lock was different from the game's, so I had to order a <A HREF="https://www.play-asia.com/freeloader/13/701ik">GameCube FreeLoader</A> (also from Play-Asia.com) and wait yet another week or so for it to ship to my house.</P>
	<P>When the FreeLoader finally arrived in the second half of August, and I used it to defeat the regional lockout and play the game, I was absolutely thrilled. Compared to its predecessor, <CITE>GNT2</CITE> is a massive leap in quality: in my opinion, the two biggest areas of improvement are the addition of the very exciting 4-player battle mode (which the first game lacked) and the more than doubling of the number of playable characters, from the 10 of the previous game to 23&mdash;I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Orochimaru, who I would use as my main fighter in all subsequent games of the series. There is also the addition of the shadow fighting, computer-versus-computer, and three-man squad modes (though without being able to switch fighters mid-battle), as well as new stages and the shop where unlockables can be purchased. Whereas <CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</CITE> had only managed to keep me occupied for a week or two, with <CITE>GNT2</CITE> I probably played it for almost a month the first time around before shelving it; afterwards, I picked it up again at least once or twice prior to buying <A HREF="gnt3.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 3</CITE></A> in August 2007.</P>
	<P>Even with its numerous improvements over the first game, though, <CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2</CITE> still felt to me like it was missing some things. Perhaps most obviously, all of the genin teams in the game besides Team 7 are missing one member, despite that character having been introduced already in the anime/manga: Rock Lee and Neji are in the game, but Tenten isn't; Shikamaru and Ino are in, but Ch&#x14D;ji isn't; Kiba and Hinata are in, but Shino isn't; and Gaara and Kankur&#x14D; are in, but Temari isn't.</P>
	<P>Still, <CITE>GNT2</CITE> was, without a doubt, a positive step for the series, and set the stage for <CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 3</CITE>.</P>
