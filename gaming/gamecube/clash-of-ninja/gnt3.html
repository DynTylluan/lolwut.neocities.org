	<H2><CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 3</CITE></H2>
	<P>I ordered this game online in mid-August 2007 from a Web site called Games-Asia.com, which seems to have gone out of business since then. By that point, I was extremely obsessed with <CITE>Naruto</CITE> and very much into the <CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</CITE>/<CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen!</CITE> series of fighter games, so I awaited the arrival of <CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 3</CITE> (<CITE>GNT3</CITE>) with much anticipation. Like <A HREF="gnt2.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2</CITE> (<CITE>GNT2</CITE>)</A>, the previous game in the series that I also bought, this was an import that took a seemingly-eternal 2 to 3 weeks to ship from Hong Kong to my house in the United States.</P>
	<P>It really was worth the wait, however, because <CITE>GNT3</CITE> includes the genin missing from <CITE>GNT2</CITE>&mdash;that is, Tenten, Ch&#x14D;ji, Shino, and Temari&mdash;as well as very powerful characters like Jiraiya, Tsunade, the Third Hokage, and Itachi, bringing the number of playable characters to 29. In addition, there is more depth in the fighting system: guard break is introduced in this game, and nearly all of the characters are given alternative specials, activated usually with Down+X instead of just pressing X. It also introduces mission mode (among a few other new game modes), which is a very interesting way to play. (I remember struggling quite a bit with mission 32, as Sasuke is not a character I use much.)</P>
	<P><CITE>GNT3</CITE> is definitely my most-played game in the entire series; it was the one I happened to be playing right around the time <A HREF="../../../tv/cn/toonami.html">Toonami</A> was airing the final pre-filler episodes of the English dub of <A HREF="../../../tv/cn/toonami/naruto.html"><CITE>Naruto</CITE></A> in the United States, when my dedication to the franchise was probably at its most intense. I played it on-and-off for about two years, from around September 2007 to August 2009, when I bought <A HREF="gnt4.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekit&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 4</CITE></A>. I played it for so long despite knowing about its sequel because, for me, <CITE>GNT3</CITE> almost felt like the final game in the series; I felt like I had all the playable characters, game modes, and stages I could ever want, so there was no need to spend money on the sequel when <CITE>GNT3</CITE> already seemed pretty much complete. Eventually, though, I did decide to purchase the sequel.</P>
