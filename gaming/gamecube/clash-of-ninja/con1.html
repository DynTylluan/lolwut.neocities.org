	<P>Note that this page is about the first game in the series, which, somewhat confusingly, shares the same name with the entire series. I am specifically talking about the North American release of the game, the one with this cover art:</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="../../../images/con1-cover-art.jpg" WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="503" ALT="Cover art for the North American version of Naruto: Clash of Ninja" TITLE="Cover art for the North American version of Naruto: Clash of Ninja"></P>
	<P>This game was released in North America on 7 March 2006; by then, <A HREF="../../../tv/cn/toonami/naruto.html"><CITE>Naruto</CITE></A> had been airing in the United States for several months, and I had already become a dedicated Narutard, so I bought the game soon after its release.</P>
	<P>It didn't manage to keep me occupied for a very long period of time: I played it rather intensively and enjoyed it for about a week or two before I grew bored of it. The game has only 10 playable characters, three of which need to be unlocked. As for game modes, there are only score attack, time attack, survival, a story mode, training, versus computer, and player-versus-player; besides the last one, which is a 2-player mode, all the others are single-player only. There are no 4-player modes at all, nor (if you have played the sequels) three-man squad, mission, shadow fighting, and computer-versus-computer modes. Compared to <A HREF="gnt3.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekti&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 3</CITE></A> and <A HREF="gnt4.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekti&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 4</CITE></A> (and perhaps even <A HREF="gnt2.html"><CITE>Naruto: Gekti&#x14D; Ninja Taisen! 2</CITE></A>), which have many more playable characters and game modes, <CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</CITE> feels to me more like a demo than a full game.</P>
	<P>Still, in this first game of the series, the developers did manage to nail the core mechanics of the fighting system, as well as the cel-shaded graphics, both of which are present in all of the sequels with little modification. (<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvIMFDsL0iM">The main menu soundtrack</A> is also my favorite out of all the four GameCube games in the series; it's definitely more nostalgic for me than the other main menu themes.) By itself, I found <CITE>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</CITE> to be a good game at its core, with a solid fighting system but quite lacking in content; there is too little to do, and it has much unfulfilled potential. Fortunately, this game laid a solid foundation for the entire series, and after finishing it, I was hooked and wanted more. A few months later, when I learned about the sequel, I did not hesitate to buy it.</P>
