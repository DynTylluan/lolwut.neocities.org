	<H2><CITE>Super Mario Galaxy</CITE></H2>
	<P>I got this game soon after its release in North America on 12 November 2007. It was the first game from the <CITE>Super Mario</CITE> franchise I ever owned, and I can still recall enthusiastically bringing it home, loading it up, and immediately being impressed by the typical Nintendo polish of <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Das-sb93RXo">the opening scenes</A>, a feeling that would persist for the entirety of my experience playing this game. Unlike many other video games I've played, however, in the case of <CITE>Super Mario Galaxy</CITE>, I played it intensively for maybe upwards of a month, from November to December 2007, and possibly into 2008, before I set it down and never returned to seriously playing it again. This was certainly not due to my finding the game unfun; probably the best explanation that I can give you for this is that my attention was occupied by many other video games that were more attractive and fun to me.</P>
	<P>The main goal of the game is to collect stars by completing missions; there are 120 such stars, though only 60 are required to play the final Bowser boss battle. Regrettably, sometime in (probably) 2010 I ended up deleting all of my saved game data on my Wii, including my game data for <CITE>Super Mario Galaxy</CITE>, and thus all records of my progress in this game have been lost. However, I can still clearly remember having accumulated, without much difficulty, well over 60 stars (I cannot remember the exact number I had before I stopped playing the game, though it was probably somewhere around 80), but I delayed playing the final Bowser boss battle, having decided that I would collect as many stars as I reasonably could before undertaking it. Ultimately, I stopped playing the game&mdash;and then deleted my Wii's save data&mdash;before I ever got around to even attempting the boss battle, so this game is, admittedly, another one of my unfinished titles.</P>
	<P>Although the gameplay is quite fun, it is the outer space setting and the visuals&mdash;which together result in remarkable and wildly creative environments&mdash;and especially the soundtrack that I remember the best. Nintendo truly held nothing back when it came to this game's music, hiring a full orchestra to perform (I think) every composition. My favorite pieces from the game's soundtrack are <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy8Sn6DHIi0">the Good Egg Galaxy theme</A>, which plays during the game's first few missions; the <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iqMMGNixvk">first</A>, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SHfac0jtOc">second</A>, and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sN2DpfOhTo">third</A> variations of the theme of the Comet Observatory, the location which serves as the game's overworld and which I have calming memories of exploring while listening to the music that would play as a way to relax between playing missions; and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVH6Gl7W0hI">the Gusty Garden Galaxy's theme</A>. Of the last composition I am particularly fond; no other piece of music in this game I associate more strongly with <CITE>Super Mario Galaxy</CITE> than this one. It is, in my opinion, the best track in the whole game, as well as one of the finest pieces of music I have ever had the good fortune of coming across in any video game, and I strongly urge you to listen to it&mdash;even if you've never heard it before and therefore hold no nostalgia for it, I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.</P>
	<P>I also have very warm memories of watching <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKlJmUg5uZU">a video recording of a live orchestral performance of the Gusty Garden Galaxy's theme</A> on <A HREF="../../comp/youtube.html">YouTube</A> near the end of 2007 (I think that I saw the video prior to even buying the game, in which case it was certainly another motivator for my eventual purchase). As I watch this video today, I am simultaneously flooded with memories of playing <CITE>Super Mario Galaxy</CITE> and of my fun experiences on old YouTube, and with the realization that, as of November 2020, it has already been <EM>thirteen years</EM> since I first viewed this video and played what was, at the time, a cutting-edge blockbuster Wii game from Nintendo nearly every day after school while sitting, comfortably cool, on our artificial-leather couch back in the winter of 2007&ndash;2008, when the days got dark early and the room was lit almost exclusively by the light coming from our big-screen TV.</P>
