	<P>Note that there are many different versions of this game that exist today on several different platforms, but I am here specifically referring to <A HREF="https://www.linerider1.net/">the second Flash version of <CITE>Line Rider</CITE></A>. Gameplay in that version consists of using the mouse to draw lines, on which a little man with a sled, who obeys simulated laws of physics, can ride; the complexity of the track drawn is limited only by the player's own ability and imagination. Additionally, although it is not actually enforced by the game, it is considered a goal by many players to keep the man on his sled throughout the entire course of the track; if he falls off at any point due to being moved around too roughly, then the track is considered a failure.</P>
	<P>I believe I learned of this game through <A HREF="../../../comp/youtube.html">YouTube</A> in July or August 2007 (at the very latest, I already knew about it by the time the 2007&ndash;2008 school year began), when I was using that site one day and stumbled upon the many videos uploaded to it by other users who had recorded runs of their custom <CITE>Line Rider</CITE> tracks. Immediately I was interested, and watched many <CITE>Line Rider</CITE> videos before finally heading to a site which hosted a copy of the game and trying it out for myself. After messing around for a bit and becoming acquainted with the game's mechanics, I eventually went through the trouble of designing and drawing my own course, and then recording (using <IMG SRC="../../../images/hypercam.jpg" WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="20" ALT="Unregistered HyperCam 2" TITLE="Unregistered HyperCam 2">, of course) a run through it in which, I can still remember, the little man did not fall off his sled; I then uploaded this video to my first YouTube account sometime either in August or the very beginning of September 2007. Regrettably, this video has been lost to the ages: that first YouTube account of mine no longer exists, and meanwhile my local copy of the video&mdash;which I failed to back up&mdash;was lost when I was forced to restore my computer to a pre-installed factory image on my hard drive in the aftermath of a later malware infection.</P>
	<P>It wasn't a particularly terrible loss, however: the course itself was not anything truly special or fantastic, since it was only my first real attempt; the video also lacked any music in the background and hence was completely silent and somewhat boring to watch. It was nothing compared to some of the videos I saw on YouTube back then, such as <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcu8ZdJ2dQo">Line Rider - Jagged Peak Adventure</A></Q>, <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8ULJGboOE">Line Rider Super Mario Bros. 1-1</A></Q>, and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/user/techdawg">TechDawg</A>'s videos that he uploaded prior to (and also including) <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiUWCfzuvLg">Line Rider - Monumental&trade; A Line Rider Short by TechDawg</A></Q>, all of which I still look back upon very fondly. Of TechDawg in particular I have much respect and admiration&mdash;his tracks always feature incredible artwork, made even more impressive by the fact that they were drawn using only the rudimentary tools available in <CITE>Line Rider</CITE>. His tracks, in my opinion, remain unsurpassed, especially the one he recorded in the video <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTnT66LGrdY">LineRider <Q>Make Believe</Q> A Line Rider Short by TechDawg</A></Q>, which, with its sentimental song and anime artwork, is still my all-time favorite. (If you watch only one of the videos I've linked to here, then watch this one; of all the <CITE>Line Rider</CITE> videos I've seen, it by far brings forth within me the strongest feelings of nostalgia for 2007.)</P>
	<P>I got bored of the game soon after I recorded the video of my first track, and afterwards I never returned to seriously playing it again. I would still occasionally watch <CITE>Line Rider</CITE> videos on YouTube, though (including TechDawg's), and I also recall seeing <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=line+rider+mcdonalds">McDonald's commercials featuring the game</A> later on in 2008, but today I remember it primarily as a Flash game I played intensively during the second half of my summer break from school back in 2007.</P>
