	<H2>My First Crew</H2>
	<P>The first crew I ever joined was <A HREF="http://cerulean.puzzlepirates.com/yoweb/crew/info.wm?crewid=5005389">Lunar Eclipse</A> (see also <A HREF="https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Lunar_Eclipse_(Midnight)">the crew's article on the wiki</A>), which belonged to the flag <A HREF="http://cerulean.puzzlepirates.com/yoweb/flag/info.wm?flagid=10005363">Blue's Royals</A> (see also <A HREF="https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Blue%27s_Royals">the wiki article</A>), and whose respective captain and king was <A HREF="http://cerulean.puzzlepirates.com/yoweb/pirate.wm?target=Bluefinn">Bluefinn</A> (see also <A HREF="https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Bluefinn">his wiki article</A>). I probably joined Lunar Eclipse (and hence Blue's Royals) sometime in late March or early April 2006, and I was definitely a member by 11 April 2006.</P>
	<P>In my earliest days on <CITE>Puzzle Pirates</CITE>, I had been wary of joining a crew too soon, and was waiting to discover one which I found to be sufficiently large, well-established, competent, and friendly. After jobbing for a pillage run by Lunar Eclipse (I cannot remember for sure if Bluefinn himself was present during it), I felt impressed enough by the whole experience that I accepted the crew invitation and joined a crew for the first time; as I was already a subscriber, I was then immediately promoted from cabin person to pirate, per the crew's promotion policy. About two months later, I recall undergoing officer training under my fellow crewmate <A HREF="http://cerulean.puzzlepirates.com/yoweb/pirate.wm?target=Redstarrebel">Redstarrebel</A> (who I think was a fleet officer when I first joined the crew, and was later promoted to senior officer) and soon afterwards being promoted to officer.</P>
	<P>I also remember that, soon after becoming an officer, I actually grew bored of <CITE>Puzzle Pirates</CITE> and took my first break from the game around late June or July 2006. When later I returned to playing the game during late 2007, I discovered that, sadly, both the crew and flag (and even Bluefinn) had by then largely gone dormant, and so with much reluctance I finally left Lunar Eclipse at that point. As far as I know, since then the crew has never returned to the size that it was and the level of activity that it had in 2006.</P>
	<P>Still, though, Lunar Eclipse, Blue's Royals, and Bluefinn all hold a special place in my heart. Bluefinn in particular I remember as being an active captain, who often ran pillages himself; he was very skilled at battle navigation against brigands/barbarians, and it wasn't uncommon for him to damage them fully while taking absolutely no damage himself, and then wasting no time moving in to grapple, thus giving us a quick and easy victory in the swordfight/rumble. He was an easygoing and pleasant fellow, and despite the great size of the crew&mdash;it was well over 100 members by the time I joined&mdash;he still managed to be accessible to all of us: I can recall a handful of times in which I had direct, one-on-one conversations with him, and he even took notice of my skill in the alchemistry puzzle and, to my great delight, gave me the crew title of alchemist.</P>
	<P>Pillages run by Lunar Eclipse were always fun and successful, and I miss them, Bluefinn, the crew itself, and the flag very much. Although I've joined a few more crews and flags since leaving Lunar Eclipse and Blue's Royals, all of which have since disbanded or gone dormant, I would most definitely, if given the power and the choice, bring back Lunar Eclipse and Blue's Royals rather than any of the others.</P>
