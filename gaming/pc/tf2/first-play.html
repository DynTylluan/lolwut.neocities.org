	<H2>Playing <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE> for the First Time</H2>
	<P>Back in May 2009, when I still maintained an account on <A HREF="../../../comp/youtube.html">YouTube</A>, I was using that site one day and stumbled upon another user's channel, which happened to have <Q><A HREF="http://www.teamfortress.com/classes.php?class=spy#movie">Meet the Spy</A></Q> (which, at the time, had just been released) as the channel's featured video. I was curious, so I watched the video and found it entertaining and interesting; I then wanted to know what <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE> was, so I did a Web search and ended up reading about the game on Wikipedia. Although I cannot remember exactly, what probably happened next was that I thought the game looked like fun, but not fun enough that I immediately bought it that day. However, what I do remember without a doubt was that I was at my local Best Buy with my family when I saw the boxed version of <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE> in the video games section, and decided to buy it then, on 31 May 2009, a date that's been conveniently saved on my <A HREF="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mercenary">Mercenary medal</A>:</P>

	<P>We returned home, and I began to install the game on my <A HREF="../../../comp/microsoft/winxp.html">Windows XP</A> computer. It was during this installation that I first became aware of Valve's Steam <DEL>bloatware</DEL> <INS>software</INS>, a program that I hated then and still hate now&mdash;but that is a different subject for <A HREF="../steam.html">a different page</A>.</P>
	<P>After I installed the game, I started it up and waited for it to load the main menu, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV4WYPt5o9o">which looked quite different back then</A> (that video is pretty close to what I remember the main menu looking like at the time). The boxed version of the game I bought came with no instructions other than a card giving basic movement controls, and as I didn't know about the official wiki back then, I was very ignorant of even the basics of the game, which made me rather nervous to play for the first time (it is a multi-player game, and I didn't want the other players to get angry at me for being terrible at it).</P>
	<P>Somehow, I managed to find out that there were different game modes; at the time, the only game modes that existed were Control Point, Capture the Flag, Territorial Control, Payload, Payload Race, and Arena. I was certainly intimidated and wanted to choose a <Q>simple</Q> game mode, so I ended up playing the Arena mode. I still remember the first map I ever played, which was <A HREF="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Watchtower">Watchtower</A>&mdash;a good map that, unfortunately, nobody seems to play these days.</P>
	<P>Connecting to the game servers took much longer back then: my estimate is that it took well over a minute, while today I can get connected in probably less than 30 seconds. When I finally connected to the server running Watchtower, I had to choose my class. Again I wanted to pick a <Q>simple</Q> (in my perception) class, so I chose Soldier (which is funny, because for many years now I very rarely, if ever, play Soldier; he is by far my least-played class).</P>
	<P>I don't think I played for very long. I can remember heading into the main tower room as a Soldier and shooting rockets, trying to kill members of the other team. I might have gotten lucky and made one or two kills and assists during this first play session, but I died many times. I cannot remember if I switched classes during this very first session of mine, or if the server changed maps and I stayed to play on the new map, or if I switched servers afterwards; the only thing I can really remember is playing Soldier for some number of rounds on Watchtower. Despite getting very few (if any) kills and dying so much, I still found the game to be fun; this would be the first day of my nearly 12-year history with <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE>.</P>
