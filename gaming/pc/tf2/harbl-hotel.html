	<H2>The Greatest Map Ever Made</H2>

	<P>That map would be Harbl Hotel, of course.</P>
	<P>This is a rather old Control Point map made by a fellow named Xenon. In addition to the map itself, he also recorded a video walkthrough in which he gives tips and reveals secrets for it; these original walkthroughs <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3hRzpY6nkM">have been re-uploaded by someone else to YouTube</A> (see also <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=901Alg-4tMU">part 2</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hDC7d0zMk">part 3</A>).</P>
	<P>This is definitely a map that appeals to old <A HREF="../../../comp/4chan.html">4chan</A> and old /b/ culture: almost all of the images that are found inside the main building are (if I had to give a date) pre-2008 4chan /b/ memes. Even the map itself <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/Habbo_Hotel">is based on a real hotel</A> that's been raided regularly as part of a long-standing /b/ tradition. There are even two pools in the map, both of which slowly damage you if you jump into them. Why? <A HREF="https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/Pool%27s_Closed">Because they have AIDS, of course!</A></P>
	<P>As Harbl Hotel would appear very strange to anybody who isn't a 4chan regular&mdash;or even to all but the old /b/tards&mdash;its appeal is, of course, rather limited. I have only known about three <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE> servers that actually run or ran the map: <A HREF="desuroom.html">the original Desuroom (the one established by JTFish), which ran the map 24/7</A>; the 4CHAN PARTY VAN, which had it as part of its map rotation; and the current <A HREF="../../../desuroom-revival.html">Desuroom Revival</A>, with IP address <A HREF="steam://connect/162.248.88.175:27015">162.248.88.175:27015</A>, which also runs the map 24/7. Since 2010 (when I first discovered it), I have played on this map for many, many hours, mostly back on the original Desuroom when it was still up and running, so I know it very well. It is my favorite <CITE>Team Fortress 2</CITE> map, if I haven't already made that clear.</P>
	<P>However, I am not going to describe the map in detail here, because I think it is better that you <A HREF="https://gamebanana.com/maps/174589">download it</A> and experience it for yourself. I will mention some of the map's highlights, though: a disco room with a DJ booth offering a selection of 16 songs that can be played, and that can be heard throughout the entire map; a handful of interactive flying vans; many buttons scattered here and there that teleport you to various places on the map, including the skybox; and the ability to flood most of the map. If you want to play Harbl Hotel, as of February 2021, the only server of which I am aware that runs the map 24/7 is the Desuroom Revival I mentioned in the previous paragraph.</P>
