	<P>This is an old science fiction turn-based strategy game that, to the best of my memory, I believe I got sometime in 2001. Unfortunately, I cannot remember if my mother went out shopping one day, saw the game, and bought it for me because she thought it would be the sort of game I would enjoy, or if I tagged along with my mother while she was shopping, saw the game myself, and then asked her to buy it for me because of the rather cool-looking monster on the cover art:</P>

	<P>(That is an Antaran, by the way.)</P>
	<P><CITE>Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares</CITE> (<CITE>MOO2</CITE>) is old enough of a game that it was rated Kids to Adults (K-A) instead of Everyone (E), but I would hardly say that it's a game for kids: although there is nothing in it that is inappropriate for children, it is nevertheless quite a complex game (the manual is over 160 pages in length) that most kids would probably find too difficult, too boring, or both.</P>
	<P>This game was very different from nearly every other PC game I owned at the time, which were overwhelmingly children's educational games with bright colors and happy, friendly, smiling characters; by contrast, <CITE>MOO2</CITE> was dark and even depressing, particularly <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2WGs1OC0wU">the main pieces of background music (they are the first 5 minutes and 40 seconds of the video)</A>. There is no in-game tutorial, and because I certainly didn't bother to read the manual back then, as a kid I was very confused whenever I was playing this game. I had almost no understanding of the game's mechanics, and so oftentimes I would simply click around randomly on menus or advance to the next turn just to see what would happen. I lost so many times back then, even on the easiest difficulty level, that <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOkkuQx5T3k">the game's defeat cutscene (it is the first 30 seconds of the video)</A> has been forever engraved on my memory. Despite losing so much, though, I never got angry at <CITE>MOO2</CITE>; I knew even then that this game was a special one in my collection, and I accorded it the proper respect by handling the CD and jewel case very carefully.</P>
	<P>I played this game a handful of times during the early 2000s, each time learning a few more aspects of gameplay, but I was still largely ignorant of most of the game's mechanics, and so I still lost constantly. The last time in the 2000s that I ever played <CITE>MOO2</CITE> was probably around 2007/2008, when I was a little older and thus (I believed) more capable of grasping the game's complexity, but even then I remember losing&mdash;or, at least, struggling to win&mdash;on the easiest difficulty. Ever since then, I have not played the game until April 2019, when, as an adult now, I read through the manual and played a few full games starting from the easiest difficulty level, until I managed to win a game even on the Hard difficulty.</P>
