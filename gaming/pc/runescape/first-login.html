	<H2>The First Login</H2>
	<P>In September 2004 I started a new school year in a new class. I became close friends with one of my new classmates, and soon he started to tell me about a wonderful computer game he played called <CITE>RuneScape</CITE>. He would tell me that he could fight monsters, use magic, examine things for funny descriptions, and use items with one another (and usually be greeted by the message, <Q>Nothing interesting happens.</Q>), and that there was a place in this game called the Wilderness (which brought to my mind pictures of a forest, even though it was actually a desolate wasteland in the game) where I could kill and be killed by other players. He told me the old trick to remembering the game's name: it was spelled the same as putting the words <I>run</I> and <I>escape</I> together. He talked up <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> and wanted me to start an account so the two of us could play together; after a bit of convincing, I agreed to give it a try, upon which he even created another account for me and leveled its skills a bit so I could have a head start in the game.</P>
	<P>I cannot remember exactly how long it took for him to level up my new account. It was probably a week, or two weeks at the very most. Regardless, one day he said the account was ready for me to use.</P>
	<P>It was probably October 2004 when I logged in to <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> for the first time. Unfortunately, I can't remember what else happened during that day: I can't remember what had happened in school, or what I did at home before logging on, or what I did for the rest of the evening. I am also unsure if my friend called me after school that day to push me to log in, but I remember the login process and the login session itself in exceptional detail.</P>
	<P>The <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> Web site looked quite different in late 2004, before <A HREF="http://services.runescape.com/m=news/new-look-website">the big re-design in September 2005 that added the updates scroll</A>. It looked something like this:</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="../../../images/runescape-website-old.jpg" WIDTH="1024" HEIGHT="509" ALT="The RuneScape Web site in late 2004" TITLE="The RuneScape Web site in late 2004"></P>
	<P>I clicked Play Game, which took me to the detail select page; I clicked High Detail (my computer was pretty high-end then), which took me to the world select page; and I picked a F2P world (I don't remember which one), and my browser (<A HREF="../../../comp/microsoft/winxp/ie6.html">Internet Explorer 6</A>, of course!) started to load <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3eXMF9V-2k">the familiar login screen with the familiar theme</A>.</P>
	<P>I was somewhat interested at this point, but I didn't spend too much time staring at the login screen. I entered the username and password for the account my friend had made for me, and logged in.</P>
	<P>Back then, the welcome message was merely a window over the actual game world; you could still rotate the camera without having closed the window first. It looked something like this, only bigger and with more information displayed:</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="../../../images/runescape-welcome-message-old.jpg" WIDTH="761" HEIGHT="496" ALT="The old RuneScape welcome message" TITLE="The old RuneScape welcome message"></P>
	<P>I don't think I read the message in great detail. I closed the window and saw the game for the first time. It was truly astounding for me back then to see those 3D graphics. I had, of course, played many games with better 3D graphics on my <A HREF="../../gamecube.html">GameCube</A> for about a year before this, and I had also played 3D games on my computer before that as well, but <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> still managed to captivate me all those years ago. Whereas those GameCube games ran on a dedicated console connected to my TV, and whereas those other computer games with 3D graphics came in a CD, and I had to go through the trouble of installing them first, with <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> I saw 3D graphics running flawlessly in my little Web browser, with no installation required, which was completely new for me. I could switch to another window and then switch back to the game with ease; it was like <EM>magic</EM>.</P>
	<P>Because this was the account my friend had leveled for me, I didn't start on Tutorial Island; instead, I was in Varrock's east bank. My friend had given the character a dark red shirt, blue pants, fair skin, and short brown hair, though it was wearing a bronze medium helmet when I first logged in. I think the combat level of this account was around 15.</P>
	<P>I heard the song <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtBigNNwcmo">Garden</A></Q>, which plays (among other areas) in Varrock's east bank. For me, this song will forever represent my first moments in <CITE>RuneScape</CITE>. I know that for most people, that song would be <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNW9TAwImBY">Newbie Melody</A></Q>, which plays only on Tutorial Island, but because my friend had already made the account for me and completed Tutorial Island, my situation was a bit unusual. (I don't really consider <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8oQw0nm0M">Scape Main</A></Q>, the login screen theme, as representing my first moments in <CITE>RuneScape</CITE>, even though, technically, it was the first song from the game I heard and <Q>Garden</Q> was the second. I suppose it is because I wasn't actually in the game yet when I heard it.)</P>
	<P>I can only say that my first login session was confusing. Tutorial Island was skipped for me, my friend didn't give me any information about in-game navigation, and I hadn't yet read the manual. Instead of moving around or talking to anybody, my character just stood there in the bank while I took in everything that I saw. There were what appeared to be other people around me, and a lot of yellow text appearing and disappearing in the game world, and black and blue text was moving pretty quickly in the chat box. I tried to read some of it, but couldn't really understand much: what the hell were <Q>lobs</Q>? What the hell was a <Q>scimmy</Q>? I saw several 2D skull and crossbones, some stationary and some moving, throughout the game world, which confused me even further.</P>
	<P>I started clicking on things with the mouse. I clicked the interface buttons, but couldn't make sense of much, so I started clicking on things in the game world. I can't remember exactly, but I think I right-clicked some other players and saw the typical menu options (Walk here, Follow, Trade with, Cancel). I also used the keyboard arrow keys to rotate the in-game camera, staring in awe as I rotated actual 3D graphics 360 degrees <EM>in my Web browser</EM>.</P>
	<P>This all must have lasted a few minutes, because I recall that <Q>Garden</Q>, which has a length of about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, eventually stopped playing, and the game was then absolutely silent for a little while, as I didn't know how to enable music looping, and this was before area sound effects were added to the game.</P>
	<P>I felt a bit intimidated by <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> after this experience, so I clicked on the <Q>LOG OUT</Q> button and logged off; at that point, I did not know if I wanted to continue with this game or not.</P>
