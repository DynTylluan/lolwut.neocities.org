	<H2>Worlds 1 and 2</H2>
	<P>Any <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> veteran who played before the introduction of the Grand Exchange will remember that World 1 and World 2 both used to be unofficially (and later, officially) designated hubs for player trading. <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulhC2B0EW-8">On World 1 (which was F2P), the activity was centered around Varrock's west bank</A>, while <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA8i5wY0Nbo">on World 2 (which was P2P), it was centered around Falador's east bank and the large park to the north of it</A>. If you ventured to those spots, you would find a great mass of players and would then be quickly swamped in a sea of flashing, sliding, scrolling, waving, shaking, and/or multicolored text advertising countless buy/sell offers.</P>
	<P>I actually didn't visit Worlds 1 and 2 very much back then. For most smaller and quicker trades of less value, I preferred simply heading to the nearest major bank of whatever world I was playing on; for more difficult or larger trades worth millions of coins, I generally went to the official forums to find or post an offer, and then coordinated with whoever happened to respond. I logged on to Worlds 1 and 2 pretty infrequently, perhaps if I was trying to buy or sell something but was so far unable to do so in another avenue; a few times I logged on purely out of boredom, and once or twice because I felt rich enough to browse the great deal of sell offers and maybe buy something that happened to catch my fancy.</P>
	<P>Despite this, I still miss dearly the incredible liveliness of World 1's Varrock and World 2's Falador&mdash;the whole experience was like walking through a crowded virtual bazaar. Worlds 1 and 2 <EM>always</EM> seemed full in those days, and oftentimes I would have to click the login button many, many times until I could finally connect. After the Grand Exchange was put into the game, the trading activity was reduced considerably, as most folks preferred the more automated and usually quicker&mdash;but far more dull and boring&mdash;system of the Grand Exchange to the constant manual typing that was typical of Worlds 1 and 2, and which was required for advertising your offer. It is a shame, because the trading activity that went on daily in those two worlds back then was, I think, a very exciting and unique player-driven element of <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> that definitely contributed to the fun and experience of the game. The Grand Exchange may be quicker and requires less effort, perhaps, but it is also less fun.</P>
