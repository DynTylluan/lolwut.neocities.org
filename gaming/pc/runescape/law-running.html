	<H2>Law Running on World 66</H2>
	<P>Before the trade limit was implemented in January 2008, there was <A HREF="https://runescape.salmoneus.net/tips/fast-free-laws-service.html">a very large player-run law running <Q>company</Q> that operated on World 66</A>. Although I am unsure of when it was first established, by the time I started participating as a runner in (most likely) early 2007, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoKDQX8z2TI">it was already a very large enterprise</A> that always seemed to have plenty of players taking part as both runners and crafters.</P>
	<P>Though I had been playing <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> regularly for over two years (besides a roughly 8 month break in the middle) prior to discovering this operation, I was still rather young and largely ignorant of a method of making money within the game that was both reliable and decently quick (at least by my standards back then, anyway). This company managed to change that: I recall very clearly that it took me about 2 hours of running to accumulate 1,000 law runes, which throughout 2007 sold for right around 300 coins each; hence in 1 hour I could obtain 500 laws, meaning that law running for this company on World 66 made me 150K per hour&mdash;a good rate (in my view) back in 2007 for a player like me with a combat level at the time in (I believe) the 70s and 80s. It became by far my main method of making money within the game during early and mid-2007, and soon every Saturday and Sunday morning (with very few exceptions) I would log on to World 66 and run for the company for 2 hours each day, for a total of 4 hours spent and 600K made per weekend.</P>
	<P>Because I was persistent in doing this nearly every weekend, pretty soon the value in coins of my bank grew into the millions, and then into the tens of millions: my estimate is that by the time I took a break from <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> in late August 2007, the items on my account were worth a total of perhaps 15 to 20 million coins (which was not an insignificant amount in those days), whereas prior to discovering this method, the total was probably around 1 million. With the money I made through law running, I was able to finance my purchases of all four of the melee Barrows sets (though, admittedly, I never owned more than two of those sets simultaneously), as well as finance the training of my Construction skill (AKA the rich man's skill) to level 70. For once, I no longer considered myself poor within the game.</P>
	<P>It did, of course, get quite tedious and boring at times. To fight back my boredom, I would hum along with the game's background music&mdash;the song <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC7eegwbDwE">Background</A></Q> in particular I associate with my law running experiences&mdash;or strike up spontaneous conversation with the great number of other players who also happened to be running, or alternate between the bank in Draynor Village and the one in the Void Knights' Outpost for a change of scenery. Occasionally I would mute the game's music and listen to other music on my computer&mdash;I especially enjoyed listening to <Q><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD-Y5MdAHVk">San Francisco</A></Q> (a song that happened to be included on the Dell Dimension desktop I was using at the time) by an obscure band named Secondhand Jive; even today, when I listen to it, it still brings back vivid memories of law running.</P>
	<P>When I returned to playing <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> again in mid-2008, the trade limit had already been put into the game. I was deeply disappointed, and even angry, to learn that the World 66 law running company had largely disappeared&mdash;no doubt the trade limit was responsible, as the <Q>unbalanced trades</Q> (<Q>unbalanced</Q> by whose account, exactly?) between runners and crafters that were a normal part of the operation were no longer allowed. I had to find another decent way of making money, and my hostility towards the trade limit only increased further.</P>
