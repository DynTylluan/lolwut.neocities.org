	<H2>Rune Headquarters and Other Help Sites</H2>
	<P>I used <A HREF="https://www.runehq.com/">Rune Headquarters (RuneHQ)</A> a lot back in the day as my main help site. I cannot remember when I first discovered it, but I was definitely using it by mid-2005, and continued to use it each time I started playing <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> again. It has been an incredible help with almost every aspect of the game, from its skill guides to dungeon maps to mini-game guides to quest walkthroughs to full clue scroll solutions to skill calculators to full monster, item, and NPC databases. (There was much more material on the site than I can discuss in a few paragraphs here.) It pretty much made the official game manual obsolete (though I still liked to read it on occasion). Sometimes, instead of playing the game, I would just browse RuneHQ and read some of the guides out of pure interest.</P>
	<P>I knew, of course, that there were other help sites around, such as <A HREF="https://www.tip.it/runescape">Rune Tips (Tip.It)</A> (which I think was more popular than RuneHQ back then) and <A HREF="https://runescape.salmoneus.net/">Sal's Realm of <CITE>RuneScape</CITE></A>. I would visit these other help sites irregularly, maybe if I was looking for a piece of information that I couldn't find on RuneHQ, but I preferred RuneHQ (if only because I found out about it before the others) and overwhelmingly used it rather than the other sites.</P>	
	<P>When <CITE>Old School RuneScape</CITE> (<CITE>OSRS</CITE>) launched in February 2013, I jumped right in and started playing, but when I went to RuneHQ again, I discovered that it focused on the <Q>main</Q> <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> game, not <CITE>OSRS</CITE>; the other major help sites were like this as well. Instead of using <A HREF="http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape_Wiki">the <CITE>OSRS</CITE> Wiki</A> (like I imagine a lot of other players did), I instead turned to <A HREF="http://archive.org/web">the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</A>, which has <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20070823010146/http://runehq.com">an archived version of RuneHQ from August 2007</A>. I realize this may strike some people as strange and even extreme, but this <EM>is</EM> a nostalgia site, after all, so this decision of mine shouldn't surprise you.</P>
	<P>The heyday of the help sites is over, and has been over for years now: when <CITE>OSRS</CITE> was released in February 2013, I could tell that the wikis were where most players turned to for help, and even a few years prior to that, the wikis had already become pretty big. But I will always prefer the old RuneHQ to any of the wikis&mdash;again, this is a 2000s nostalgia site. In recent years, after I stopped playing <CITE>OSRS</CITE> (after realizing it wouldn't stay the static nostalgia game it was meant to be) and started playing <CITE>RuneScape</CITE> private servers that seek to emulate the 2006/2007 era, I still use an Internet Archive version of the RuneHQ site from the proper time period as my main source of game help.</P>
