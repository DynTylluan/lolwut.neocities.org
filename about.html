	<H2>About the Web Site</H2>
	<P>Most of the material on here concerns things that are important to me, and perhaps might be interesting to you. I find that many of the things that I believe are important, and that I treasure, were made or were popular during the glorious first decade of the new millennium, the 2000s. It is my little space on the Web to discuss, reminisce, and honor those things which have had a profound influence upon me, an escape from the largely disappointing decade of the 2010s. Nostalgia runs strong here.</P>
	<P>I do not intend to change the design or layout of this site; I intend to keep it simple design-wise, like an early 1990s Web page, partly to keep it extremely lightweight (Web page bloat is a cancer), partly to keep it compatible with as many old browsers as possible (I use <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401">HTML 4.01</A> and only a bit of very quick and basic inline CSS here and there; HTML5 is a meme), and partly because I am a rather uncreative fellow who has never bothered to learn any image editing software and who uses Microsoft Paint for everything. You should be able to view this site in any browser, but I am a staunch Microsoft loyalist and have only ever tested it in Internet Explorer, which you should be using if you aren't already doing so. <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx"><IMG SRC="images/msie.gif" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" ALT="Best viewed with Internet Explorer" TITLE="Best viewed with Internet Explorer" STYLE="FLOAT: RIGHT;"></A></P>
